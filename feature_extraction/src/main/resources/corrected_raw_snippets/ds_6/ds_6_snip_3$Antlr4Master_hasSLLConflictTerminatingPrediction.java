	 * Computes the SLL prediction termination condition.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * This method computes the SLL prediction termination condition for both of
	 * the following cases.</p>
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The usual SLL+LL fallback upon SLL conflict</li>
	 * <li>Pure SLL without LL fallback</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><strong>COMBINED SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>When LL-fallback is enabled upon SLL conflict, correct predictions are
	 * ensured regardless of how the termination condition is computed by this
	 * method. Due to the substantially higher cost of LL prediction, the
	 * prediction should only fall back to LL when the additional lookahead
	 * cannot lead to a unique SLL prediction.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Assuming combined SLL+LL parsing, an SLL configuration set with only
	 * conflicting subsets should fall back to full LL, even if the
	 * configuration sets don't resolve to the same alternative (e.g.
	 * {@code {1,2}} and {@code {3,4}}. If there is at least one non-conflicting
	 * configuration, SLL could continue with the hopes that more lookahead will
	 * resolve via one of those non-conflicting configurations.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Here's the prediction termination rule them: SLL (for SLL+LL parsing)
	 * stops when it sees only conflicting configuration subsets. In contrast,
	 * full LL keeps going when there is uncertainty.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><strong>HEURISTIC</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>As a heuristic, we stop prediction when we see any conflicting subset
	 * unless we see a state that only has one alternative associated with it.
	 * The single-alt-state thing lets prediction continue upon rules like
	 * (otherwise, it would admit defeat too soon):</p>
	 *
	 * <p>{@code [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;}</p>
	 *
	 * <p>When the ATN simulation reaches the state before {@code ';'}, it has a
	 * DFA state that looks like: {@code [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]}. Naturally
	 * {@code 12|1|[]} and {@code 12|2|[]} conflict, but we cannot stop
	 * processing this node because alternative to has another way to continue,
	 * via {@code [6|2|[]]}.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>It also let's us continue for this rule:</p>
	 *
	 * <p>{@code [1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]] a : A | A | A B ;}</p>
	 *
	 * <p>After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
	 * State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
	 * conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
	 * However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not stop
	 * working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned with
	 * states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt 3 is not
	 * associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
	 * looking for input reasonably, don't declare the state done.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><strong>PURE SLL PARSING</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>To handle pure SLL parsing, all we have to do is make sure that we
	 * combine stack contexts for configurations that differ only by semantic
	 * predicate. From there, we can do the usual SLL termination heuristic.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><strong>PREDICATES IN SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>SLL decisions don't evaluate predicates until after they reach DFA stop
	 * states because they need to create the DFA cache that works in all
	 * semantic situations. In contrast, full LL evaluates predicates collected
	 * during start state computation so it can ignore predicates thereafter.
	 * This means that SLL termination detection can totally ignore semantic
	 * predicates.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Implementation-wise, {@link ATNConfigSet} combines stack contexts but not
	 * semantic predicate contexts so we might see two configurations like the
	 * following.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>{@code (s, 1, x, {}), (s, 1, x', {p})}</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Before testing these configurations against others, we have to merge
	 * {@code x} and {@code x'} (without modifying the existing configurations).
	 * For example, we test {@code (x+x')==x''} when looking for conflicts in
	 * the following configurations.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>{@code (s, 1, x, {}), (s, 1, x', {p}), (s, 2, x'', {})}</p>
	 *
	 * <p>If the configuration set has predicates (as indicated by
	 * {@link ATNConfigSet#hasSemanticContext}), this algorithm makes a copy of
	 * the configurations to strip out all of the predicates so that a standard
	 * {@link ATNConfigSet} will merge everything ignoring predicates.</p>
